# Omnidirectional Robot odometry

This repository contains the first laboratory project for the [Robotics course 2021/2022](https://www4.ceda.polimi.it/manifesti/manifesti/controller/ManifestoPublic.do?EVN_DETTAGLIO_RIGA_MANIFESTO=evento&aa=2021&k_cf=225&k_corso_la=481&k_indir=T2A&codDescr=089013&lang=IT&semestre=2&idGruppo=4336&idRiga=271084) of the Polytechnic University of Milan.

The project is implemented in ROS, an open-source robotics middleware suit.

## Requirements

## Description

In this project we were required to read from a bag file some information and calculate the odometry and other parameters of the robot.

We were given:
- Wheels encoder state
    - RPM (noisy)
    - Ticks (more accurate)
- Nominal robot parameters: `r`, `l`, `w` encoder CPR `N`, gear ratio `T`
- Ground truth (GT) pose of the robot (acquired with OptiTrack)

And we were required to:
